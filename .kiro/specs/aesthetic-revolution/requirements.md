# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LoveQuest Aesthetic Revolution is a comprehensive UI/UX transformation that will convert the current emotionally sterile landing page into a breathtaking, immersive, and deeply romantic digital experience. This feature focuses on creating a two-act narrative structure with cinematic transitions, a living watercolor dreamscape background, and ethereal floating elements that evoke wonder, intimacy, and magic. The transformation must feel handcrafted, personal, and alive while maintaining technical excellence and 60fps performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Two-Act Navigation Structure

**User Story:** As a user visiting LoveQuest, I want to experience a captivating narrative journey that builds anticipation and creates emotional connection, so that I feel immersed in a magical, romantic digital world from the very first moment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a Prologue landing page without the main navigation bar
2. WHEN the user is on the Prologue page THEN the system SHALL provide only a "Begin Our Journey" button as the gateway to the main application
3. WHEN the user clicks "Begin Our Journey" THEN the system SHALL trigger a cinematic page transition lasting approximately 1.5 seconds
4. WHEN the transition begins THEN the system SHALL animate background elements to gently swirl and converge towards the center
5. WHEN the transition progresses THEN the system SHALL accelerate Memory Motes and fade them into a sparkling nebula effect
6. WHEN the transition completes THEN the system SHALL fade to soft warm white (hsl(45, 35%, 96%)) and gracefully reveal the main application view
7. WHEN the main application loads THEN the system SHALL display the navigation bar and main content with a graceful fade-in animation

### Requirement 2: Living Watercolor Dreamscape Background

**User Story:** As a user experiencing LoveQuest, I want the background to feel like a living, breathing watercolor painting that creates a cozy and romantic atmosphere, so that I feel transported to an enchanted, intimate digital space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a multi-layered SVG background instead of raster images
2. WHEN rendering the base layer THEN the system SHALL apply a subtle off-white paper texture using SVG filters
3. WHEN displaying the color wash layer THEN the system SHALL show slowly shifting amorphous gradients of Blush Pink, Peach Puff, and Lavender Haze
4. WHEN animating the color gradients THEN the system SHALL create a near-imperceptible 30-second loop that mimics wet watercolor paint bleeding
5. WHEN rendering botanical elements THEN the system SHALL display delicate, semi-transparent SVG outlines of vines, flower petals, and leaves
6. WHEN the user moves their mouse THEN the system SHALL create subtle parallax motion in the botanical elements that feels like floating in water
7. WHEN viewed on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain infinite scalability and crispness through SVG implementation

### Requirement 3: Ethereal Memory Motes System

**User Story:** As a user interacting with LoveQuest, I want to see beautiful, glowing particles that represent memories and feelings floating naturally through the interface, so that I feel surrounded by magical, living elements that enhance the romantic atmosphere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Memory Motes are displayed THEN the system SHALL use lucide-react icons (hearts, stars, music notes, sparkles) styled as ethereal particles
2. WHEN rendering each mote THEN the system SHALL apply randomized opacity between 0.1 and 0.6
3. WHEN sizing motes THEN the system SHALL apply randomized scale between 0.5 and 1.2
4. WHEN styling motes THEN the system SHALL apply CSS blur filter (1.5px) and soft glow box-shadow using accent colors
5. WHEN blending motes THEN the system SHALL use CSS mix-blend-mode (screen or soft-light) for luminous integration
6. WHEN animating mote movement THEN the system SHALL create natural meandering paths using sine wave or Perlin noise algorithms
7. WHEN controlling animation timing THEN the system SHALL use randomized durations between 8s-15s with different delays to prevent synchronization
8. WHEN motes enter the viewport THEN the system SHALL gracefully fade them in at the bottom
9. WHEN motes exit the viewport THEN the system SHALL gracefully fade them out at the top
10. WHEN running animations THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance using hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity

### Requirement 4: Performance and Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a user experiencing LoveQuest, I want all animations and interactions to be silky-smooth and responsive, so that the magical atmosphere is never broken by technical limitations or poor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any animation plays THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent 60fps performance
2. WHEN using CSS animations THEN the system SHALL utilize hardware acceleration through transform and opacity properties
3. WHEN rendering on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full responsiveness and visual fidelity
4. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL ensure all SVG elements scale perfectly on high-DPI displays
5. WHEN multiple animations run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent performance degradation or visual jank

### Requirement 5: Emotional Design Compliance

**User Story:** As a user experiencing LoveQuest, I want every visual element to contribute to a cozy, cute, romantic, and lovely atmosphere, so that I feel emotionally connected and enchanted throughout my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any interface element THEN the system SHALL contribute to the overall "cozy, cute, romantic, and lovely" aesthetic
2. WHEN experiencing transitions THEN the system SHALL feel handcrafted and personal rather than generic or automated
3. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN the system SHALL evoke feelings of wonder and intimacy
4. WHEN comparing to the original design THEN the system SHALL completely eliminate any "sterile" or "amateurish" visual elements
5. WHEN evaluating the overall experience THEN the system SHALL feel like a magical, living digital embrace

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining LoveQuest, I want the codebase to follow React best practices and be well-documented, so that the magical experience can be sustained and enhanced over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices and conventions
2. WHEN examining components THEN the system SHALL include clear, descriptive comments explaining complex animations and effects
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms and avoid unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL align with project philosophy in animations.ts and emotionalExperience.ts files
5. WHEN testing responsiveness THEN the system SHALL work flawlessly across all device sizes and orientations
